Real-Time Awana Games Scoreboard

# Context
Awana is a program for K-5 kids on Friday nights and involves activities such as games, memorizing bible verses, and listening to a speaker. These kids are divided into two groups: Sparks (K-2nd grade) and T&T (3rd-5th grade). Within each group, there are four color teams (Red, Blue, Yellow, Green) each with about 15 kids. Each color team has 2-3 volunteer leaders (usually high schoolers or parents) that oversee them as they rotate through the stations. This project will focus on Awana Games, drawing from insight as a former games leader at our church. Specifically, we are proposing a complete revamp of the scorekeeping system to a digital format, which is currently done by a scorekeeper using pen and paper on a clipboard. 

The general flow of games time is as follows:
1. Games Time Setup - Game leaders bring the needed equipment to the Mandarin congregation and set up the cones and whatever they need for the games planned for that session. 
2. Sparks/T&T come to the Mandarin congregation from their previous station, and each color team lines up along their respective color line (a box around the central circle)
3. Team leaders take attendance and report to the scorekeeper.
4. Game leaders will announce the game to be played, pass out equipment to the team leaders, and clarify rules and setup. 
5. After every round, the scorekeeper updates the current score accordingly. 
6. At the end of games time, one of the game leaders will announce the standings one by one from last to first. 



# Pain Points
We have identified three major pain points as games leaders.
1. Players Have No Awareness of Real-Time Score
    * Kids are always constantly pestering the scorekeeper to see the current score. Since the score is recorded manually on paper, they donâ€™t know the score in real-time and how standings change after every round. 
    * This can be frustrating for the scorekeeper trying to do their job properly and also distracts the kids from engaging with the actual games. 
    * Not being able to see the current score is a strategic blindfold for the teams, who are unable to plan strategically based on the current standings. 
2. Manual Scorekeeping is Tedious and Error-Prone 
    * Manually writing and updating the score after every round is extremely tedious and repetitive. It is also easy to make mistakes which could severely impact the final result.
    * Handling ties is difficult because the scoring completely changes based on the type of tie and there is no standardized system to handle tie scoring. 
    * Inefficiency in computing final scores, fixing scoring mistakes, and relaying team placements each round between leaders leads to wasted time that hinders the flow of games time. 
    * Before games begin, team leaders are responsible for taking attendance and reporting to the game leaders. However, this is very difficult as kids are all over the place and running around. This wastes a TON of time and gives the kids less time to play organized games. 
3. No Easy Way to Track and Analyze Games History
    * Tracking Games history requires manual bookkeeping which requires extended effort from the game leader outside of games time. Otherwise, there is no way to track history unless you want to manually parse through a bunch of papers.
    * Not being able to digitally analyze important data such as attendance, team statistics, and games/rounds played is a missed opportunity for the church to potentially plan around.
